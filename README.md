chn-intel-feeds
================
This container will connect to a CIF instance, generate feeds on a regular interval, and make the indicators for 
those feeds available in a "one-indicator-per-line" format suitable for a number of protection devices.

All configuration lives in the `.env` file which is imported via the docker-compose.yml file.
